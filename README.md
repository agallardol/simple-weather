<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Simple Weather is a simple app to check the weather. It was made for Desktop and created to learn, practice and test different frameworks and architectures keeping in mind reactivity, datacentrism and portability.

This is a solo-dev showcase work made in just a few hours so you can expect unstability and bugs.

### Built With

* [Tauri](https://tauri.app/): Native apps made with Rust, Typescript and Web technologies.
* [Angular](https://angular.io/): Framework to implement the UI.
* [Elf](https://ngneat.github.io/elf/): Framework to implement State Management and Persistence.
* [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS Framework to implement the UI.

Of course, there are a lot of additional technologies but these are the core of this application!
